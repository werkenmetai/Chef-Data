To get a Client ID and Client Secret, you need to create an app registration within the Exact Online App Store.

## Requirements

- Define your **Redirect URI** (used by the authorization server to redirect users back to your application)
- The redirect URI should always be a **public URL** (cannot use localhost)
- The redirect URL must be in **HTTPS**

## App Registration Options

1. **App Store partners** can register apps via App Store | Register an app
2. **Users of Exact Online** can register API keys via Register and manage API keys

> **Note**: Exact Online has to review your app in order for it to be used by other customers. In the Request Permission section, click Request to allow your app to be connected to by other customers.
