name: Deploy MCP Server

# Deploys the MCP server to Cloudflare Workers
# Lessons learned:
# - Use pnpm (not npm) because of workspace:* dependencies
# - Don't specify pnpm version in action - let package.json handle it
# - Include pnpm-lock.yaml in paths to ensure lockfile changes trigger deploy
# - Run pnpm install from root to resolve workspace dependencies
